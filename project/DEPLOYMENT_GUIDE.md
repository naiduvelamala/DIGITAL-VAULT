### 🔧 **What You Need to Do:**

#### 1. **Deploy Move Smart Contracts**
```bash
# Install Aptos CLI
curl -fsSL "https://aptos.dev/scripts/install_cli.py" | python3

# Initialize Aptos account
aptos init

# Navigate to contracts
cd move-contracts

# Compile contracts
aptos move compile

# Deploy to testnet
aptos move publish --named-addresses digital_vault=<your-address>

# Copy the deployed contract address
```

#### 2. **Update Contract Address**
- Open `src/services/aptosService.js`
- Replace `const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = "0x1";` with your deployed address

#### 3. **Configure IPFS (Optional)**
- Create account at [Pinata](https://pinata.cloud)
- Get API keys
- Create `.env` file from `.env.example`
- Add your Pinata keys

#### 4. **Test the Application**
```bash
# Install Petra Wallet browser extension
# Visit: https://petra.app/

# Start the app
npm run dev

# Test workflow:
# 1. Connect Petra wallet

# 3. Set time lock (future date/time)
# 4. Enable geo lock and set location
# 5. Deploy capsule to blockchain
# 6. Wait for unlock conditions
# 7. Access and download file
```
